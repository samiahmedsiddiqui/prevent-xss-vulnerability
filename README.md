# Prevent XSS Vulnerability

This plugin provides the functionality for `Reflected XSS` and `Self-XSS` in `WordPress`.

For Reflected XSS, it checks the URL and redirects it if you enabled the `Enable Blocking`
option and URL contains any Vulnerable code in it. It only block some parameters which are
not allowed in URL and shown [here](#block-parameters). You can skip some of the 
parameters from it if you still like them to be used.

To provide more security, `Prevent XSS Vulnerability` also escape the HTML in the
`$_GET` parameter which is commonly used to get parameters in PHP from the URL and
print them in the HTML. This way, HTML properties will not work if anyone provided it in
the URL.

There are many ways by which the plugin can be tested but it may varies for different sites
according to their structure and development functionality.
